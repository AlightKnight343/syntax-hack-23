Losing your precious slippers at the Delhi Bangla Sahib Gurudwara is no 
foreign concept to Sikh Delhites. The Gurudwara has decided to hire DPSI Syntax 
to develop an app or an interface that lets you choose which locker to keep your precious 
slippers and other footwear in during your visit. Access to the lockers is digitally 
controlled by the app, so you also need to provide a method/mechanism to obtain your 
slippers back after your visit is complete (you may use anything like NFC to establish this).
